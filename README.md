Description:
Welcome to the EssentiaList: A Todo App built for those who want to focus only on the essentials!

This is the backend to this app. It was built using Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and SQL. I used Postico and Insomnia for manual testing. The database and wireframes were designed in advance to facilitate the building process.

Technologies:

1. Ruby and Ruby-On-Rails for the backend framework.
2. JavaScript and Vue.js for the frontend framework.
3. Postgres and SQL for the relational database management system.

How to Get Started:

1. Clone backend and frontend repos.
